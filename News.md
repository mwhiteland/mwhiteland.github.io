- **Appointment as Lecturer at Department of Computer Science, Loughborough University**

Super excited about turning a page with moving to the UK and joining the wonderful Loughborough University community. I started on August 19, 2024.

- **Success at International Mathematics Competition for University Students!**

During Autumn of 2023, together with [Mehdi Golafshan](https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_9054334/fr/repertoire?uid=u241893) I was coaching ULiège Mathematics students towards the International Mathematics Competition for University Students [https://www.imc-math.org.uk/](https://www.imc-math.org.uk/) held in Blagoevgard, Bulgaria. Two students took part in the competition from ULiège, and I am happy to congratulate Adrien Philippart de Foy and Antoine Kinable for their success! See [here](https://www.mathematics.uliege.be/cms/c_12912032/en/imc-2024) for a bit more.
