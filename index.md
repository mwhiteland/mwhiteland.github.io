I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Liège, Department of Mathematics](https://www.mathematics.uliege.be/cms/c_4179137/fr/mathematics).


## About me
I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Mathematics from University of Turku, Finland in 2013.

I completed my PhD studies at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Turku, Finland, in 2019 under the supervision of [Juhani Karhumäki](https://www.math.utu.fi/en/home/karhumak/) and [Svetlana Puzynina](http://math.nsc.ru/~puzynina/).

During 2019-2021 I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org), Saarbrücken, Germany, working in the Foundations of Algorithmic Verification group led by [Joël Ouaknine](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~joel/).

From September 2021, I have been a FRS-FNRS postdoctoral researcher working with [Michel Rigo](https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_9054334/fr/repertoire?uid=U016860).
